                        reading, or you may choose to read it aloud with the class. Beginning with the anchor text will
                        ground students in concepts and academic vocabulary that are key to discussing the Big Question.
                        As students read the other texts in the set, they will compare their new understandings, as well

                            have changes to communication technology affected people’s lives? </i>
                        Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">How do you think <i>Communication Through the Years</i> will
                            help you think about the Big Question? What is one type of technology that you use to
                            communicate? How do you think it has changed people’s lives?</span></p>
                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Preview Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p>Have students find and read timeline entries that have the words <i><span
                            class="bold">technology, telegraph,</span></i> and <i><span class="bold">devices.</span></i> Discuss
                        the meaning of each word with the class. Ask:
                        <span class="blue_scripting"> What is an example of <span class="bold">technology</span>? A
                            <span class="bold">device</span> is something made for a specific purpose. Often, people use
                            this word for electronic tools. What devices do you use? Long ago, people used <span
                                class="bold">telegraphs</span> to send messages quickly. How do people send messages
                            quickly today?</span>

                            Years</i> includes words that might be new or challenging. During class discussions, use
                        these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span
                            class="blue_scripting">A <span class="bold">network</span> is a group of connected people or
                            things. What do you think it means to have a network of computers?</span> </p>

                        labeled <i>What It Helped People Do</i>. Have students create their own columns in a notebook or
                        on a piece of paper. Encourage them to use the charts to track inventions as they read, using
                        vocabulary words from the text. An entry for <i>telegraph</i> might look like this:
                    </p>
                    <p>[insert t-chart with right column called Communication and left column called What It Helped People Do; insert the following text in right column:] telegraph

                    <p>Display a T-chart graphic organizer. At the top of the left column, write “Chronological

                        range of years with a description. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">Where could you look if you
                            wanted to find out about events in the 1950s? </span> Guide students to use the timeline to
                        locate the descriptions. Then ask: <span class="blue_scripting">Why do you think the writer
                            decided to use a timeline instead of another type of text? What does it help you understand
                            about the events?</span> </p>

                    <p>Return to the T-chart graphic organizer. At the top of the right column, write “Timeline.” Help
                        students fill in the column with how a timeline helps them understand a writer’s ideas. For
                        example: “shows the order of events,” “helps readers locate what happened in a year or time
                        period”</p>

                            have changes to communication technology affected people’s lives?</i> Ask: <span
                            class="blue_scripting">How do you think cell phones have affected people’s lives? How have
                            cell phones changed over time?</i></span></p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Preview Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p>Have students find and read sentences in the text that have the words <i><span

                            class="bold"><i>connection.</i></span> Discuss the meaning of each word with the class.
                        Say:<span class="blue_scripting"> An <span class="bold">advance</span> is an event or invention
                            that helps people do new things. How was the cell phone an advance
                            in communication? A <span class="bold">signal</span> is something that sends information.
                            What is an example of a signal? How do phones help people make <span
                                class="bold">connections</span> with others?</span></p>

                        discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For
                        example: <span class="blue_scripting">What predictions would you make about the <span
                                class="bold">design</span> of cell phones in the future?</span></p>
                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold">T-Charts</span></h3>
                    <p>Demonstrate creating a T-chart with columns labeled <i>Communication Invention</i> and <i>What It

                        sheets of paper. Ask them to track inventions in cellphone technology using the charts. An entry
                        for <i>smartphone</i> might look like this:
                    </p>
                    <p>[insert t-chart with right column called Communication Invention and left column called What It Helped People Do; insert the following text in right column:] smartphone

                        contrast structure, and how it helps them understand the writer’s ideas. For example: “helps

                    <p>Return to the T-chart. Write “Photographs” at the top of the right column. Work with the class to fill
                        in the column with

                    <h3 class="normaltext mb2"><span class="bold uppercase">Big Question</span></h3>
                    <p>Remind students of the Big Question: <i>How have changes in communication technology affected people’s lives?</i> Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">How do you think <i>Codes Through History</i> will help you think about the Big Question? What do you already know about codes and their importance in communication? How do you think codes might have changed over time?</span></p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Preview Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p>Have students find and read sentences in the text that have the words <i><span
                                class="bold">symbols, signal,</span></i> and <i><span
                                class="bold">system.</span></i> Discuss the meaning of each word with the class. Draw a smiley face and ask:
                        <span class="blue_scripting">Is this a <span class="bold">symbol</span>? What does this symbol mean? How would you describe a <span class="bold">system</span> of communication? A <span class="bold">signal</span> can be a message or an alert. What kind of code would you use to send a signal?</span>
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="normaltext mb2"><span class="bold uppercase">Oral Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p> Some of the vocabulary in <i>Codes Through History</i> includes words that might be new or challenging. During class discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span
                            class="blue_scripting">A <span class="bold">code</span> is a system of numbers, letters, or other symbols. What are some examples of codes? How might you make your own code? </span> </p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext mb2"><span class="bold">T-Chart</span></h3>
                    <p>Demonstrate creating a T-chart with columns labeled <i>Communication Invention</i> and <i>What It Helped People Do</i>. Have students create their own T-charts in their notebooks or on sheets of paper. Ask them to add details about codes in history using the charts. An entry for <i>semaphore code</i> might look like this: </p>
                    <!-- <p>[a word web with <i>moon</i> in the center, and with <i>full moon, month, phases, sky,</i> and <i>season</i> branching from it]</p> -->
                        <p>[insert t-chart with right column called Communication Invention and left column called What It Helped People Do; insert the following text in right column:] semaphore code

                    <p><span class="bold">Text Structure</span> Explain that <i>Codes Through History</i> is written with a compare and contrast structure. Say: <span
                        class="blue_scripting"> Writers compare by showing how two or more things are the same. They contrast by showing how the things are different.</span> Point out the pictures of semaphore code and Morse code. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">These are both codes that help people send messages. How do you think these two codes are different?
                        </span></p>

                    <p>Display a T-chart graphic organizer. At the top of the left column, write “Compare and Contrast Structure.” Work with the class to fill in the column with what they know about compare and contrast structure, and how it helps them understand the writer’s ideas. For example: “helps readers understand when events happened”</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Text Features</span> Say:  <span class="blue_scripting">You’ve read many texts that have phrases or words in bold print above a group of words. These are section headings. They tell you something about the information you are about to read in a specific section of a text.</span> 
                        Point out the bold heading <span class="bold">What Is a Code?</span> Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What does this heading tell you about the information in this section?</span>
                        Guide students to understand that the heading tells them they will read to learn what a code is, which will prepare them to read the rest of the text.                    </p>

                    <p>Return to the T-chart. At the top of the right column, write “Headings.” Work with the class to fill in the column with how headings help them understand the writer’s ideas. For example: “helps readers understand what they are about to read”</p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Big Question</span></h3>
                    <p>Remind students of the Big Question: <i>How have changes in communication technology affected people’s lives?</i> Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">How do people use the Internet today? How do you think they communicated before the Internet? How did the Internet change people’s lives?</span></p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Preview Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p>Have students find and read sentences in the text that have the words <span
                            class="bold"><i>network, Internet,</i></span> and <span
                            class="bold"><i>device.</i></span> Discuss the meaning of each word with the class. Say:
                        <span class="blue_scripting">A <span class="bold">network</span> is a group of connected people or things. What does it mean for a computer to be part of a network? What kinds of <span class="bold">devices</span> can connect to the Internet?</span>

                    </p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Oral Vocabulary</h3>
                    <p>Some of the vocabulary in <i>The History of the Internet</i> includes words that might be new or challenging. During class discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span class="blue_scripting">A <span class="bold">system</span> is a group of parts that work together. Minitel is one example of a system. What is another example?</span> </p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold">T-Chart</span></h3>
                    <p>Create a T-chart with a right column labeled <i>Communication Invention</i> and a left column labeled <i>What It Helped People Do</i>. Have students create their own columns in a notebook or on a piece of paper. Encourage them to use the charts to track inventions as they read, using vocabulary words from the text. An entry for <i>ARPANET</i> might look like this:
                    </p>
                    <p>[insert t-chart with right column called Communication Invention and left column called What It Helped People Do; insert the following text in right column:] ARPANET
                        <br>[insert the following text in left column:] connect computers in a network

                    <p><span class="bold">Text Structure</span> Explain that <i>The History of the Internet</i> is written with a chronological structure. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">A text written with this structure tells the time order of events, beginning with the earliest event related to the topic.</span>
                        Direct students’ attention to the section of the text titled <span class="bold">Why It All Began.</span> Ask a student to summarize the section. You may wish to use a timeline to track the events in the text, with entries such as the following: <i>1950s: Researchers needed to share information; 1958: ARPA was created; 1980s: The Internet as we know it today began.</i> Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">Why do you think the writer chose to describe these events in the order they happened?</span></p>

                    <p>Display a T-chart graphic organizer. At the top of the left column, write “Chronological Structure.” Work with the class to fill in the column with what they know about chronological structure and how it helps them understand the writer’s ideas. For example: “helps readers understand the connection between events”</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Text Features</span> Direct students’ attention to the map on screen 5 (Printable Text p. x) and explain that it shows ARPANET, a network of computers that could share information with each other. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">Maps are useful features that help readers understand where things are located.</span> Point out a dot on the map and tell students that it represents one computer in the network. Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What does the map help you understand about ARPANET?</span> (Possible responses: how many computers were part of the network; where computers in ARPANET were located)</p>
                    <p>Return to the T-chart. At the top of the right column, write “Maps.” Help students fill in the column with how maps help them understand a writer’s ideas. For example: “give information about where something is located”</p>

                    </p>
                     <ul class="small-bullet">
                        <li>The invention should use one of the communication methods you have read about.
                        </li>
                        <li>The invention should help improve this communication method.</li>
                        <li>In your diagram, show the appearance of the invention and the way it works. Include labels.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>Students can refer to information they have written in Write About the Big Question for each text to aid their thinking and planning. They may also use the <span class="bold"><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="activitySupport"
                        popupref="popup-ar-31">Project Template</a></span> to help them organize and clarify their thinking as they plan their projects. Encourage students to use the vocabulary they’ve learned from the texts.</p>

                    <p>Provide time for students to practice sharing their culminating project. If they are working 
                        with a partner, remind them to work collaboratively and follow agreed upon rules, norms, and protocols.</p>
                    <p>Use the bulleted points below to model good speaking and listening skills.</p>

                    <ul class="small-bullet">
                        <li>When I share my project, I look at the audience. I don't keep my eyes down.</li>
                        <li>As I speak, I make sure that everyone can hear what I am saying.</li>
                        <li>I pronounce each word clearly and correctly.</li>
                        <li>I do not rush, but speak clearly and at a natural pace.</li>
                        <li>I pay attention with my eyes and ears when others are speaking. </li><br>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold">Celebrate!</span></h3>
                    <p>Have students share their projects with the class. As students share, be sure to model and encourage strong listening skills.</p>

                    <p>An important part of building a vibrant classroom culture is creating an atmosphere in which all
                        students feel empowered to participate in powerful classroom conversation. You may have noticed
                        that
                        your students who are naturally extroverted often participate freely in a whole-class
                        discussion,
                        while those who are more introverted or, perhaps, who come from cultures that respect different
                        classroom norms, may need encouragement to share. You can use sentence prompts like these to
                        invite
                        all students into the conversation:</p>
                    <p>“That’s so interesting … please tell me more!”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone explain that in a different way?”</p>
                    <p>“What are some examples of that?”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone add on to that idea?”</p>
                    <p>Sharing and discussing ideas will often involve agreeing and/or disagreeing with what others say.
                        As
                        students listen carefully and respond thoughtfully to their classmates’ ideas, encourage them to
                        express themselves in respectful and constructive ways. You may wish to post these sentence
                        starters
                        prominently, so students can refer to them often:</p>
                    <p>“I agree, and I also think <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl" aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.”</span></p>
                    <p>“I mostly agree, but <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span class="solidl"
                            aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.”</span></p>
                    <p>“I like what you just said because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl" aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.”</span></p>
                    <p>“I respectfully disagree because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl" aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.”</span></p>
